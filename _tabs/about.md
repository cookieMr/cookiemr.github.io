I am an experienced Java Developer with 7+ years in software development. I am proficient in AWS & GCP clouds, holding few cloud certifications.

Aside from a professional life I read books (A. Christie & B. Sanderson).
And I listen to a lot of audiobooks (fantasy, s/f... nerdy stuff).
I have two dogs.
And I do some DIY project at home or with my father-in-law.
